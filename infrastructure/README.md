# Infrastructure

This document details the infrastructure setup and management for the **Idelior** e-commerce platform, a fictional project based in South Korea. The infrastructure is designed to be scalable, secure, and highly available, leveraging various AWS services to meet the demands of a modern e-commerce platform.

## Overview

## Objectives

The main objectives of the Idelior infrastructure are:

1. **Scalability:** Ensure that the platform can handle varying levels of traffic by automatically scaling resources as needed.
2. **Security:** Protect user data and system resources through robust security practices, including network isolation and access control.
3. **High Availability:** Minimize downtime by distributing resources across multiple Availability Zones (AZs) and implementing failover mechanisms.
4. **Cost Efficiency:** Optimize resource usage to reduce operational costs without compromising performance.

## Components

Detailed documentation on each infrastructure component can be found in the respective sections:

- [Initialization](./initialization/README.md)
- [Compute Resources](./compute/README.md)
- [Storage Solutions](./storage/README.md)
- [Security](./security/README.md)
- [Monitoring & Logging](./monitoring/README.md)

## Future Enhancements

Planned improvements to the infrastructure include:

- Implementing a disaster recovery plan with cross-region replication.
- Enhancing monitoring with detailed metrics and alerting mechanisms.
- Integrating additional security layers, such as Web Application Firewall (WAF) and AWS Shield.

## Conclusion

The infrastructure setup for Idelior is designed to support the demands of a modern e-commerce platform, ensuring it is scalable, secure, and highly available. This document will be updated as the project progresses and additional features are implemented.
